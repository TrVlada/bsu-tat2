I'm on the roof, you're in your airplane seat
I was nose-bleeding, looking for life out there
Reading your horoscope, you were just doing cocaine
In my kitchen, you never listen, I hope you're missing me by now
If I was a bluebird, I would fly to you
You'd be the spoon

Dip you in honey so I could be sticking to you
Daylight, you got me cursing the daylight (ooh)
Daylight, you got me cursing the daylight (ooh)
Daylight, you got me calling at all times (ooh)
Ain't gonna sleep 'til the daylight (ooh)
